										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the businesses which has benefited from support from the Smartline In Residence Scheme is Inspire Cornwall, the Community Interest Company behind the DadPad, a practical guide designed to enable fathers of newborn children to gain the confidence and skills necessary to be the very best they can be.</p>
<p>Taking your newborn baby home is an exciting and emotional time but, for some new parents, it can also be overwhelming and leave them uncertain on what to do. Help is now at hand for new dads in Cornwall, though, thanks to the launch of a new mobile app version of the DadPad.</p>
<p>The Cornwall DadPad app is available for free download on both Apple and Android devices. Once downloaded, dads simply need to enter their postcode to gain access.</p>
<p>You can read more about this news on the <a href="https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/council-news-room/media-releases/news-from-2019/news-from-march-2019/a-new-app-for-dads-in-cornwall-is-being-launched/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cornwall Council website here</a> and full details of the support provided by Smartline is <a href="https://www.smartline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Smartline-case-study-DadPad.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available here</a>.</p>
