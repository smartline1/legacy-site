										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are delighted to announce that Smartline has been awarded £4 million in further funding to continue with our project researching technology, health and housing in Cornwall.</p>
<p>Smartline is funded by the European Union and is a research and innovation project exploring the relationship between technology and the way people live in their homes and communities, which has been running since 2017 in Camborne, Illogan, Pool and Redruth.</p>
<p>It’s a collaborative partnership led by the University of Exeter with Coastline Housing, Volunteer Cornwall, Cornwall Council and the South West Academic Health Science Network.</p>
<p>Now new funding has been granted from the European Regional Development Fund to continue and expand the work. With match funding from partners and an additional contribution from Cornwall Council of £200,000, the total value of the project tops £4 million.</p>
<p>Prof Karyn Morrissey, who will head up the next phase, says: “We have been gathering hard data and insights from people and from sensors in their homes for three years and I’m excited to translate that information into new ways of improving residents’ lives.</p>
<p>“I’m so excited that we have got this extension for a further three years as it means we can start to give back to the community after they have so generously participated in the research.”</p>
<p>Cllr Rob Rotchell, Cornwall Council cabinet member for adult social care, said: “I have been fascinated to learn about what the Smartline team have been doing so far and, like them, I’m keen to see now how we can start to see impact on the ground and how we can use the data and insights to help us as we develop policy for both health and housing.”</p>
<p>Smartline also works with small and medium sized enterprises across Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly to develop innovative, technology-based products and services to meet the health and wellbeing needs of communities. During the first phase, over 170 enterprises were involved and in the next phase, from March 2020 to January 2023, this work will continue.</p>
<p>Mark Duddridge, chair of the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership, said: “I have been so impressed with the innovations produced by this project – it’s got to be one of the most successful of its kind in Cornwall. I can’t wait to see what will come out of phase two but I know it can only benefit the economy and communities in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.”</p>
