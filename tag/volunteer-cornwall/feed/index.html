										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local people making an outstanding contribution to their communities and neighbourhoods are honoured every year at <a href="http://www.coastlinehousing.co.uk/cath-awards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coastline Housing’s Customers At The Heart Awards</a>.</p>
<p>Smartline is very proud to announce that Karen Spooner has been nominated in the Partnership Project of the Year category. This category is designed to recognise a partnership that has made a positive contribution to Coastline communities or customers.</p>
<p>“Earlier this year we held a series of “guided conversations” with people living in the Camborne, Pool and Redruth areas to help us understand their wellbeing needs, aspirations and desires for their communities” said Karen Spooner, from Volunteer Cornwall, and the Smartline Community Development Manager. “Residents told us they wanted more activities which brought people together and helped them feel they belonged in their local communities. Others told us they wanted to improve their physical health.</p>
<p>Karen has been working tirelessly as part of the Smartline project to improve the lives of our participants and has setup a number of activities; from armchair exercise and community acupuncture sessions, lessons in first aid and how to use the internet safely, to providing a green space for a local community.</p>
<p>You can still vote so please visit the <a href="http://www.coastlinehousing.co.uk/cath-awards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coastline Housing’s Customers At The Heart Awards </a> and complete the form to let them know about the good things going on in your community.</p>
