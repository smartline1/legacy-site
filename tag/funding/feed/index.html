										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The South West Academic Health Science Network is offering adopters of innovation part of a £45,000 fund to encourage the spread and adoption of innovation that improves health and social care for people in the South West of England.</strong></p>
<p>Up to £1,000 in micro and £5,000 in small enabler funds are available for projects that focus on relevant health and care setting(s) and aim to facilitate faster adoption or remove a barrier that may hinder progression.</p>
<p>They welcome proposals from adopters of innovation, including technologies, services and interventions which aim to develop new insights, processes or feasibility testing.</p>
<p>Priority will be given to proposals with the potential to benefit the health and care of people in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, Devon and Somerset. They also welcome applications from innovators based outside the South West who are working with adopters in the region.</p>
<p>The deadline for applications is 4 March 2019. For more information visit the South West Academic Health Science Network <a href="https://www.swahsn.com/innovation-adoption-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The South West Academic Health Science Network have part funded the Smartline project and are dedicated to improving health and care, and spreading innovation across the region.</p>
