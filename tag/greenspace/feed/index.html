										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A community-inspired project to create a green space in an underused area in the centre of Camborne has been awarded £2,500 by the Town Council and Coastline Housing.</p>
<p>Green Space is one of a number of projects supported by the University of Exeter’s Smartline project which is exploring the impact of technology on the way people live in their homes and communities.</p>
<p>The EU-funded community research and innovation project, in partnership with Coastline Housing, Cornwall Council and Volunteer Cornwall, is working with 300 residents in Camborne, Pool and Redruth.</p>
<p>Volunteer Cornwall is supporting local groups to develop activities to help tackle social isolation and enhance the feeling of belonging within the community. From armchair exercise and community acupuncture sessions, lessons in first aid and how to use the internet safely, to providing a green space for a local community, Smartline is transforming the lives of people in the area.</p>
<p>“At the beginning of the Smartline project we held a series of guided conversations with people living in the Camborne, Pool and Redruth areas to help us understand their wellbeing needs, aspirations and desires for their communities,” said Karen Spooner, Smartline Community Development Manager. “Residents told us they wanted more activities which brought people together and helped them feel they belonged in their local communities. Others told us they wanted to improve their physical health. One of the projects we identified to take forward was Green Space.”</p>
<p>The project is centred around Coronation Avenue in Camborne where local residents had expressed an interest in gardening during the guided conversations. The group suggested developing an underused outdoor space known as the “big green” as a way of bringing people together and spending more time outdoors.</p>
<p>With support from Smartline, a community committee made up of willing volunteers was set up to lead the project, with plans being developed to create a wild flower area and raised beds and planters.</p>
<p>“This has been a brilliant way of getting the local community to work together,” said Babs Eveson, chair of the Community Green Space Committee. “When the idea for Green Space was first suggested, we went round knocking on doors to see what people thought about the idea. The overwhelming majority were all for it and so we agreed to form a committee to try and make it happen.”</p>
<p>The group drew up initial plans for the space and then worked with illustrator Mel Chadwick to produce images for how it could look. They have also been working hard to involve other local groups in the project, including students from Camborne Science and International Academy, and applying for grants.</p>
<p>The project has now been awarded £1,000 from Camborne Town Council and £1,500 from Coastline Housing.</p>
<p>Announcing the funding Deputy Mayor, Mrs Val Dalley, said: “Camborne Town Council&#8217;s amenities committee was very pleased to support the grant application from the residents of Coronation Avenue. This type of project is so important in bringing residents together and combating loneliness and isolation.”</p>
<p>“Coastline’s funding and grants committee were really pleased to give a donation to such a scheme to encourage community wellbeing, especially at a time of great change,” added a representative of Coastline Housing. “We wish the Green Space group well and many congratulations on their hard work.”</p>
<p>Work to create the new community garden will begin within the next few weeks.</p>
