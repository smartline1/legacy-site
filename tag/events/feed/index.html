										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From armchair exercise and community acupuncture sessions, lessons in first aid and how to use the internet safely, to providing a green space for a local community, Smartline is transforming the lives of people in Camborne, Pool, and Redruth.</p>
<p>To help shape our future community plans we want to hear about activities you would like to take part in over the next 12 months of the project.</p>
<p>Please help us by completing this feedback form: <a href="https://smartline.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_agkxSEjyi1na7Wt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here.</a></p>
<p>Among the successful projects helping to bring local communities together are monthly coffee mornings and exercise classes in the Wesley Chapel, here&#8217;s what some of the attendees thought:</p>
<p>“<strong>We wanted to find out what was happening in the local area and to make friends</strong>” said Shirley Roberts of the coffee mornings. “<strong>Coming to the coffee mornings has been a fantastic way of doing this and we are so grateful to Smartline for organising them</strong>”.</p>
<p>Among those taking part in the exercise classes is 81 year old Joan Hampton. Joan had recently moved into a retirement complex and was worried about “<strong>ending up just sitting in a chair and not moving</strong>” when she heard about the classes through her church and decided to give them a try.   “<strong>I can feel myself becoming fitter and stronger</strong>“ she said. “<strong>Everyone in the class is very friendly and we all have a laugh and lots of fun</strong>”.</p>
