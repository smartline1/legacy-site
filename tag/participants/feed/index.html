										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Award winning artist and photographer Ruth Purdy is launching two new community smartphone/device photography programmes for people living in the Camborne, Pool and Redruth area as part of an exciting new project to research how creativity and arts activities can be used to help improve people’s health and well-being.</p>
<p>Ruth will be offering two eight week programmes aimed at encouraging people living in the area to get together and learn new skills and make new friends. Both community smartphone photography classes sessions will begin at the end of April and are free of charge to those taking part.</p>
<p>The first programme will be held at Miner’s Court in Redruth, on Tuesday afternoons and will involve looking at the history of Camborne and Redruth through photographs, maps and stories. Participants will have the opportunity to digitise their existing photos and images as well as taking new photos using their Smartline tablet or camera phones. This material will then be used to make models and collages of local places and people, with the final results displayed at a special celebration at the end of the programme.</p>
<p>The second programme will be held on Wednesday mornings and will involve participants going “out and about” to take digital photos of a range of different locations in the Redruth and Camborne area using their Smartline tablet or camera phone. The group will be set a weekly photographic challenge, with their work exhibited at a ‘Smartline digital snappers’ event at the end of the programme. The first class will take place on Wednesday, 24 April.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that loneliness and social isolation can sometimes lead to health problems, with people feeling stressed and depressed&#8221; said Ruth. &#8220;Research shows that regular contact with creativity can improve people’s lives by developing positive behaviour and thoughts and we want to see whether this programme will produce similar results.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you would like more information on these classes please contact Karen Spooner on 07968706114 or via email to <a href="mailto:KarenS@volunteercornwall.org.uk">KarenS@volunteercornwall.org.uk</a></p>
<p>Ruth’s ground breaking community smartphone photography programme is being supported with funding from Smartline.</p>
